# assets-v2
Art stuff I use for my posts. A more organized version this time.

# Purpose
- I custom-made and use a set of graphics to make my posts look nicer.
 - My posts are on [PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/thediamondplayables/), go check it out and let me know what you think.
- They are stored here, mainly so I could update them and all sites using them (like, say, PlanetMinecraft) will also have the updated graphics.
 - I'm bad at Art and I'm learning still, so the graphics will be improved over time.

# For those who've found this:
- Keep this as a secret between us, kay?
- I'd have no problems when this inevitably gets revealed, this just makes it more valuable to those who've been able to discover this without anyone telling about it.
- Also, don't use my graphics without asking me first.
 - I know I'm bad at Art and no one would probably use this to make their posts look nicer (apart from me), but still.
